However, they still are a common problem for many people. If you have ever had a cavity or know someone who has, you know how painful and inconvenient they can be. And the good news is that with today’s technology and advancements in dental treatments, there are many more options for preventing and treating dental caries (tooth decay) than ever before.If you have noticed white spots on your teeth or feel a toothbrush doesn’t clean as well as it used to, it could be a sign of a cavity. Luckily there are many things we can do to help prevent and treat cavities if they do appear. Keep reading to learn more about cavities and what you can do if you think you have one!</p><h2>Know the signs of cavities</h2><p>One of the best ways to know if you have a cavity is to look at your teeth. If you notice white spots or a change in color on any of your teeth, these could be signs of a cavity. Another sign is a sharp pain when you eat something sweet, like a doughnut or soda. If you feel like something is wrong, but you aren’t sure, it might be a good idea to schedule an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible. It is important to catch cavities early so they can be treated as soon as possible.There are a few other signs to know about, but keep in mind that you shouldn’t ignore symptoms just because they aren’t life-threatening! If you have a toothache, see your dentist as soon as possible. If you have sensitive teeth, you should be careful with what you eat and drink, as it can make your teeth more sensitive.</p><h2>See your dentist regularly</h2><p>Even if you’ve never had a cavity, you should still be going to the dentist regularly. A good rule of thumb is to see your dentist once every six months or so. If you have dental insurance, your regular check-ups are usually covered. You should also be careful with what you eat and drink. Avoid anything that might cause damage to your teeth or expose you to a lot of sugar. This means no soda, sports drinks or even fruit punch. Limit the amount of juice you drink to about 8 ounces a day. If you love your coffee or tea, try to drink them with a sip of water instead of sugar. It may take some time and effort at first, but you will feel better and your teeth will thank you for it.</p><h2>Use a fluoride toothpaste</h2><p>One of the best ways to prevent cavities is to use a fluoride toothpaste. Fluoride is a naturally occurring substance found in many foods and water sources, but it’s not naturally abundant in your mouth. It is used in many dental offices to help prevent cavities and strengthen teeth. The American Dental Association recommends using a fluoride toothpaste with fluoride every time you clean your teeth. You can also use a fluoride mouthwash to help protect your teeth while you sleep.</p><h2>Go to the dentist for a cleaning</h2><p>If you have had your teeth cleaned in the past and it didn’t leave you with a smile as bright as you hoped, you can try again. However, it’s important to know that not every cleaning will be successful. If you’ve had the same cleaning for several years and it hasn’t done much to improve your smile, it’s time to try another cleaning method.There are several oral care products on the market that claim to be “cavity killers.” While some of them can definitely help, keep in mind that they are meant for treating existing cavities, not preventing them. They are best used in addition to a thorough cleaning by your dentist.</p><h2>Understand your diet and beverage choices</h2><p>Diet and beverage choices are two of the most common reasons for cavities. While brushing and flossing are important, they can’t clean every part of your teeth. It’s important to pay attention to what you eat and drink as well because it can lead to cavities. Sugar is the number one cause of cavities, so it’s important to cut back on how much you are consuming.Sugar can be found in a wide variety of foods, so it’s important to be more aware of what you are eating. Avoid soda, candy and other foods and drinks that are high in sugar. Also be careful of what you drink. Many people don’t think about how much sugar they are drinking when they drink soda or coffee. Try drinking more water and reducing the amount of sugar you are consuming.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Finally, remember that prevention is key when it comes to cavities. You should see your dentist regularly and follow a proper diet to help protect your teeth. If you do find a cavity, don’t worry! There are many ways to treat it and prevent it from happening again.</p>
