                                                                                                    <p>As a dental assistant, it is important to know what your patients expect from you, what they worry about most and what keeps them awake at night. Understanding what your patients think about and need from their dental office can help you provide a more effective experience and build trust. A thorough job interview combined with thorough research can help any professional nail their first job or promotion. For dental professionals, this can also mean getting hired by a new practice or moving to an existing practice that needs an extra hand. Understanding what these potential patients want can help you better prepare for your interview, make a stronger first impression and ultimately help you get hired. So what do potential patients want from their dental office? Here are some things to keep in mind if you’re looking to get hired at a practice or move over to an existing practice that could use a hand…</p><h2>Know Their Insurance</h2><p>First and foremost, you must know your patients’ insurance. It’s the first thing they’ll ask you when you start your interview. If they don’t have insurance, will they be able to get it? If they do, what would their policy require? How much will it cost them per month, per visit? What will they have to pay out of pocket? If you don’t know this information, you should ask. It’s not a difficult question and it will help you understand your patients better.If you’re working in a practice that has patients with no or limited dental insurance, you’ll have to do some creative financing. You can either accept a higher price for your services or try to find financing for those who can’t afford it.</p><h2>Be Professional</h2><p>This goes without saying, but it’s important enough to mention twice. Your patients will be interacting with you in your work environment so make sure you’re presentable, on time and treat them with respect. Being early (or late) for your appointment is one thing, but make sure you’re well-groomed with clean hair, clean nails and clean clothes. This is especially important if you’ll be handling sharp instruments. Make sure you’re dressed appropriately and use deodorant or perfume sparingly. You should also make sure your office is neat and organized. Your patients will appreciate the ability to find what they need easily. If you need to buy supplies or have a special tool on hand, keep them in the same place so patients can easily find them when they need them.</p><h2>Don’t Miss Appointments</h2><p>This goes hand-in-hand with knowing your patients’ insurance. If you don’t have their information, you won’t know when it’s time to bill them. If this happens too often, you could lose your insurance and have to take time off work to find a new job. You should always make sure you have the information for your patients so you can bill them on time. You should also inform them if you’re on vacation or sick leave so they know not to expect you on a certain day. This shows your patients that you care about them as much as they care about you.</p><h2>Be Patient-Friendly</h2><p>This is a big one. Not everyone is a patient who is willing to sit quietly for an hour while you attend to their needs. Some patients are in a hurry and need to leave. Some patients have kids who are constantly jumping around or making noise. Some patients have jobs and can’t sit for long periods of time. Make sure you know how your patients are and prepare accordingly. You can do this by asking them questions about their lives and what their needs are when they come in for a cleaning or a check-up. You can also ask them if they have any special needs. If they have small children, you can ask if they’re bringing them to the appointment. This lets you know what you need to prepare for so they don’t feel rushed or uncomfortable.</p><h2>Keep Them Hydrated</h2><p>This is another easy one. Make sure you have water available so your patients can stay hydrated. This can help prevent dry mouth, cavities and other issues that can arise when you’re not properly hydrated. Keeping your patients hydrated can also help you get more patients. Studies show that people are more likely to visit a business if they have clean water to drink.</p><h2>Help Them With Their Smile</h2><p>If your patients have a dental emergency, help them as quickly as you can. If they have a dental emergency when you’re closed, help them find another dentist. You can also provide general dental advice. Let your patients know if they should go to the dentist regularly, what their options are and what they cost. You can also explain what different dental procedures do. This can help your patients make better decisions about their oral health. This is also a good time to let them know if they should be visiting a dentist regularly. You can also provide resources for those who want to learn more about their oral health. If your patients have children, you can also provide information about the importance of dental care.</p><h2>Let Them Know That You Care</h2><p>This is a big one. Your patients will appreciate knowing that you care about them and their dental health. If you have a friendly smile and a warm personality, your patients will feel comfortable. Let them know that you care about their dental health and want them to keep coming back. Offer to send a text or an email letting them know if there is a special on their dental care. You can also let them know if there are any promotions going on. If you have a sense of humor, use it. Your patients will appreciate it and so will you.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Dental care is essential to your overall well-being and the health of your teeth and gums. It can also be expensive, so it’s important to understand what your patients want from their dental office and how to provide it. It’s also important to know what their insurance covers so you can bill them accurately. You should also be presentable, on time and treat your patients with respect. You should also know their insurance and be patient-friendly so they don’t feel rushed. Finally, you should let your patients know that you care and that you want them to come see you again.</p>
